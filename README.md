# Sokoban
sokoban project

The Sokoban project is to create a replica of the game sokoban but using lncurses which is an old graphic library that run in the terminal and can only display ascii characters. The usge of an old library ischoose for challenge/difficulty (the only tutorial i found ws the equivalent of a hello world).
The player is represented by a 'P', the boxes by 'X' and the places to move the boxes on y 'O' while '#' are the walls.

USAGE:

- Do a make re to compile everything

- Do a ./my_sokoban [map-file] where you can choose a map to play on

Control: 

- Key up = to go up
- Key left = to go left
- Key down = to go down
- Key right = to go right
